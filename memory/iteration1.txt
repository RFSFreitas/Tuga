Here's a summary of what we have accomplished in iteration one:

Set up the development environment by cloning the Tuga repository and installing its dependencies.
Modified the config.yaml file to set up the database, S3 bucket, and secure hash salt.
Created the plugins directory and initialized the database.
Started the Turtl server on port 3000 using the npm start command.
Connected to the turtl database using psql.
Created the necessary tables in the turtl database using the node scripts/create-tables.js command.
Started the Turtl server in a Docker container using the docker-compose up command.
Confirmed that the server is running and listening for Turtls on port 8181.

We have successfully completed iteration one of the project. Now, we can move on to the next iteration and start working on new features.
